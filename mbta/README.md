README

1. Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

I was able to successfully implement all the requirements of this assignment. Note: It seems as if my previous pushes to the repository before 10/25 did not go through. This is most likely a problem on my end as I forgot to check if it was successfully pushed to the repo. Hopefully the commits I made today were enough. 

2. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

Thanks to Jackie Nguyen for discussing and explaning some of the infowindow concepts to me. Stack Overflow, Google Maps API documentation were also resources used. Google Maps Spherical formula was used to calculate shortest distance

3. Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

I spent 15 hours on this project
